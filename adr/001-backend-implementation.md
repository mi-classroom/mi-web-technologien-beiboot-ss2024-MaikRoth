## Context
The project requires a system to handle video uploads, apply processing to generate long-exposure effects. The system must support adjustable settings for dynamic video processing.

## Decision
I implemented a backend using Python, Flask, Flask-SocketIO, and OpenCV to:
1. Receive video uploads through a Flask endpoint.
2. Use OpenCV to process videos for long-exposure effects.
3. Optionally isolate segments with significant changes using a windowed approach.
4. Emit processing progress in real-time via Flask-SocketIO.
5. Directly serve the resulting images from Flask for immediate access.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- **Dynamic Control:** Users can adjust FPS and window size, accommodating various video types.
- **Robust Video Handling:** Flask and OpenCV integration supports diverse video formats and robust processing.
- **Scalability:** Event-driven architecture with SocketIO supports high concurrency.

**Negative:**
- **Complex Deployment:** Requires careful setup for dependencies like OpenCV and eventlet.
- **Resource Intensity:** High resource demand could lead to bottlenecks.

**Risks:**
- **Error Handling:** Must effectively manage video processing failures to maintain usability.
