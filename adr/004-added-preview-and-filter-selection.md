===========================================

-   **Status**: Accepted
-   **Decider**: Maik Roth
-   **Date**: September 13, 2024

Context
-------

To significantly enhance the functionality and utility of the application, a new feature is to be implemented. Users should have the ability to preview the final long-exposure image and apply various filters to it. This feature not only increases the attractiveness of the application but also provides users with more control over the final result.

**Goals of this feature:**

-   **Preview Functionality**: Allow users to preview the long-exposure image based on their selected frames.
-   **Filter Application**: Provide a selection of image filters that can be applied to the preview and the final image.
-   **Improved User Experience**: Enhance user satisfaction and engagement through interactive elements.

Decision
--------

The application will be extended to include a preview function and image filters. The implementation includes the following steps:

1.  **Backend Extension**:

    -   Implement an endpoint to generate the image preview based on the selected frames and applied filters.
    -   Integrate image processing libraries to apply various filters.
2.  **Frontend Adjustments**:

    -   Add a preview section in the user interface to display the generated image.
    -   Implement a filter selection that allows users to try out different filters.
    -   Dynamically update the preview when the frame selection or filter changes.
3.  **Ensure User-Friendliness**:

    -   Design an intuitive user interface to ensure easy operation.
    -   Display loading indicators during preview generation to inform users about the progress.

Consequences
------------

**Positive:**

-   **Increased Utility**: Users can preview the final result and adjust it according to their preferences.
-   **Better Control**: Filters allow users to customize the image to their liking.
-   **Enhanced Satisfaction**: An interactive and appealing application fosters user engagement.

**Negative:**

-   **Higher Development Effort**: Implementation requires additional development time and resources.
-   **Performance Concerns**: Generating the preview and applying filters could increase load times.

**Risks:**

-   **Technical Difficulties**: Integrating new libraries and technologies may lead to unexpected issues.
-   **UI Overload**: Too many options could clutter the interface if not carefully designed.

Time Investment
---------------

A maximum of 8 hours will be invested in this issue. Time will be documented in detail to make the effort transparent.

Time Log
--------

-   **Analysis & Design**: 1 hour
-   **Backend Implementation**: 3 hours
-   **Frontend Implementation**: 3 hours
-   **Testing & Debugging**: 1 hour

Implementation Steps
--------------------

1.  **Backend Implementation**:

    -   **API Endpoint for Preview**:

        -   Develop an endpoint that accepts the selected frames and chosen filter.
        -   Process the data and generate the preview image in real-time.
    -   **Filter Integration**:

        -   Use libraries like Pillow for image processing.
        -   Implement various filter options (e.g., grayscale, sepia, blur, sharpen).
2.  **Frontend Implementation**:

    -   **Preview Section**:

        -   Include an image container to display the preview.
        -   Implement loading animations during image processing.
    -   **Filter Selection**:

        -   Add a dropdown menu or buttons to select available filters.
        -   Immediately apply the selected filter to the preview.
    -   **Interactive Elements**:

        -   Update the preview when the frame selection or filter changes.
        -   Provide user-friendly error messages in case of issues.
3.  **Testing & Debugging**:

    -   **Functional Tests**:

        -   Verify correct functionality with different frame sets and filters.
        -   Ensure compatibility with various browsers and devices.
    -   **Performance Optimization**:

        -   Analyze load times and optimize image processing procedures.
        -   Implement lazy loading and other techniques to improve performance.
4.  **Documentation**:

    -   **User Guide**:

        -   Update help pages or tooltips to explain the new features.
    -   **Developer Documentation**:

        -   Add comments and documentation in the code for future maintenance and extensions.
